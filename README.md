React Testing Library

- Not just a library, also a philosophy (opinionited)
  - Test your software the way users actually use it
    - not internal implementation
  - Find elements by accessibility markers, not test IDs
- More philosophy later

- React Test Library
  - Provides virtual DOM for tests
- Jest
  - Test runner that
    - Find tests
    - Runs tests
    - Determines whether tests pass or fail

  - `npx create-react-app color-button`
