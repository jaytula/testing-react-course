# Section 4: Sundaes On Demamand: Form Review and Popover

## Lesson 31: Intro to Sundaes on Demand

- Choose ice cream flavors and toppings and submit order
- Flavors and toppings come from server
- order is sent to server
- order number is sent back from the server

### Backdrop to Test

- more complex user interaction
  - multiple form entry, moving through order phases
- mouseover popup
  - test that element disappears from DOM
- simulating server response
  - mock service worker
- async app updates
  - awaiting DOM changes
- global state via context

### Spoiler Alert

- We will not be testing context implementation
  - only interested in testing behavior as seen by user!
- Tests no different if we used Redux, Mobx, etc
- Only difference is the test _setup_
  - make sure component is wrapped in context
  - ensure functionality
  - avoid errors

### Order Entry Mock-up

- Three main pages
  - Order Entry - Scoops, Toppings, Subtotal per section, Grand Total, Order Sundae button
  - Order Summary - Summary of Scoops, Toppings and Grand Total, Confirm order button
  - Order Confirmation - Order number, Create new order button

### Order Phase State (App-level)

- App-level states
  - `inProgress`: Order Entry page
  - `review`: Order Summary page
  - `completed`: Order Confirmation page

### Server

- Download from course repo
  - https://github.com/bonnie/udemy-TESTING-LIBRARY/tree/master/sundae-server
  - Follow instructions in _README.md_ to install
- RESTful API, runs on port 3030
- For flavors / toppings, just sends static info
  - In a real app, sould come from db
- For order, simply generates random order number
- Server not needed for functional react app testing!

  - use mock-service-worker to mock responses from server
  - server for spec, manual acceptance testing

## Lesson 33: React Bootstrap Setup

- course will use react-bootstrap
  - you can use any styling you want, or none
- `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`
- Copy under _Browser Globals_ here: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/ and
  add to `index.html`

## Lesson 34: Code Organization and Introduction to SummaryForm

### Order Summary Component

- "I agree to Terms and Conditions" checkbox
- "Confirm order" button
- PopOver for Terms and Conditions

- Test and code checkbox /button
  - Sound familiar?
- Test and code Terms & Conditions "popover"

  - syntax to test that element is no longer on page

- Later:
  - test and code summary test
  - test and code button functionality

### Code Organization

- Organize components by pages
  - `test` directory for each page
  - Jest will find and run any files that end in _.test.js_
- `src/pages/summary`
  - `OrderSummary.jsx`
  - `SummaryForm.jsx`
- `src/pages/summary/test`
  - `SummaryForm.test.jsx`

## Lesson 35: Code Quiz! Checkbox enables button

- Write tests to ensure that
  - Checkbox is unchecked by default
  - Checking checkbox enables button
  - Unchecking checkbox again disables button
- A chance to set up your own test from scatch
  - Use tests from last section as a model
  - Render the `<SummaryForm />` component
- Find checkbox and button using `{name}` option
  - Use mockup for "name" option values
- Check that tests fail! Red part of red-green testing

- Use what you remember and/or reference material
  - https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet
  - https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom

# Lesson 37: React Bootstrap Popover and Testing Library userEvent

- Test "Terms & Conditions" Popover
- Will be using React Bootstrap `Popover`: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/overlays/#popovers
- `userEvent` more appropriate
- Install `npm install @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/dom -D`
- Recommended to use `userEvent` over `fireEvent`

# Lesson 38: Screen Query Methods

- Parts of method: `command[All]ByQueryType`

  - _command_
    - `get`: expect element to be in DOM
    - `query`: expect element _not_ to be in DOM
    - `find`: expect element to appear async
  - _[All]_
    - (exclude) expect only one match
    - (include) expect more than one match
  - _QueryType_
    - `Role` (most preferred)
    - `AltText` (images)
    - `Text` (display elements)
    - Form elements
      - `PlaceholderText`
      - `LabelText`
      - `DisplayValue`

- screen Query Reference
  - https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/
  - https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet/
  - https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/#priority

# Lesson 41: "Not wrapped in act(...)" Error, Async Disappearance

- React updated element after test was finished
- Don't want to follow the advice to wrap in `act(...)`
  - Testing Library already does this for us!
  - https://testing-library.com/docs/preact-testing-library/api#act
- To remedy this error:
  - Determine what changes after the test is over (async)
  - Accounting for the change in test by:
    - awaiting the change, and
    - asserting on it
  - More info: https://kentcdodds.com/blog/fix-the-not-wrapped-in-act-warning
- waitForElementToBeRemoved

# Lesson 43 OrderEntry Server Data Introduction

- `OrderEntry` component has subcomponents:
  - Scoops `Options` - Chocolate, Vanilla, Mint Chip
    - 3x `ScoopOption` component
  - Toppings `Options` - Gummi bears, Cherries, M&Ms, Hot Fudge
    - 4x `ToppingOption` component

## Tests

- Test that option images render
- Mock Service Worker
- Mock server response for `/scoops` and `/toppings`
  - write "scoops" code together
  - "toppings" code as code quiz

# Lesson 44 Introduction to Mock Service Worker and Handlers

- Purpose:
  - intercept network calls
  - return specified responses
- Prevents network calls during tests
- Set up test conditions using server response

## Mock Service Worker Setup

- `npm install msw`
- Create handlers
- Create test server
- Make sure test server lsitens during all tests
  - reset after each test

## Mocking REST API

https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started/mocks/rest-api

```js
// src/mocks/handlers.js
import { rest } from "msw";

export const handlers = [
  rest.get("https://localhost:3030/scoops", (req, res, ctx) => {
    ctx.json([
      { name: "Chocolate", imagePath: "/images/chocolate.png" },
      { name: "Vanilla", imagePath: "/images/vanilla.png" },
    ]);
  }),
];
```

- Handler Type: `rest` or `graphql`
  - HTTP method to mock: `get`, `post`, etc.
    - Full URL to mock
      - Response resolver function
        - `req`: request object
        - `res`: function to create response
        - `ctx`: utility to build response

# Lesson 45 Setting up the Mock Service Worker

```js
# src/mocks/server.js

import {setupServer} from 'msw/node'
import { handlers } from './handlers'

// This configures a request mocking server with the given request
export const server = setupServer(...handlers)
```

- https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started/integrate/node

# Lesson 46 Tests with Mock Service Worker: Scoop Options

- Will be testing when the `Options` component calls the scoops endpoint on the
  server, it takes that data and displays them as `ScoopOptions`

# Lesson 48 Code Quiz! Topping Options from Server

- Mock Service Worker mimics response from server
  - create handler
  - create server
  - update _setupTests_ to listen for requests
- `getAllByRole`
  - search for more than one match to role
- `await findAllByRole`

  - for asynchronous DOM update of elements

- Use scoops as a model
  - type out rather than copy/paste for better learning
- add handler for `/toppings` route
- Handler can return three toppings:

```
[
  { name: 'Cherries', imagePath: '/images/cherries.png' },
  { name: 'M&Ms', imagePath: '/images/m-and-ms.png'},
  { name: 'Hot fudge', 'imagePath: '/images/hot-fudge.png' },
]
```

- Write tests in `Options.test.jsx`
- `name` option can be `/topping$/i`
- Update `Options.jsx` and create `ToppingOption.jsx`

# Lesson 50 Error Server Response Planning

- Fill in that `catch` statement we left as TODO
- Display AlertBanner component if `axios` call throws error
  - instead of content from server
- Use simple `react-bootstrap` alert
  - https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts/
  - role: `alert`
- By default, handlers return non-error response
  - Override with error response for particular tests

## Jest Debugging Tools

- Jest debugging tools in this section

  - running only one test file
  - running only one test within a file

- To give us something to debug:
  - Going to write code I know won't pass

# Lesson 51 Simulating Server Error Response in Tests

# Lesson 53 Running only Selected Tests and `waitFor`

- Use `test.only('test description', () => {})` to restricting

# Lesson 54 Review: Server Error Response and Test Debugging

- Override Mock Service Worker response for individual tests (e.g. `server.resetHandlers`)
- Misleading _Unable to find role="alert"_ error
- Isolate file by typing `p` in Jest watch mode
- Isolate test withing file with `test.only` or `test.skip`
- `waitFor` for tests where `await findBy*` is not enough

# Lesson 55 Intro to Tests for Total and Subtotals

- Will be using React Context but it doesn't really matter test-wise
- There is a subtotal for Scoops section (test in `Options`)
- There is a subtotal for Topping section (test in `Options`)
- There is a grand total which is the sum of the two subtotals (test in `OrderEntry`)

# Lesson 57 OPTIONAL React Code: OrderDetails Context

- A lot of cofing, quite complicated
  - Easy to get lost in details
- Focus of course is testing
- Complicated app for realistic testing scenarios
- Feel free to set this lecture aside

- Kent C. Dodds to set up context with embedded state
- https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react

Two components will need the context:

- OrderEntry
- OrderSummary

Create context file

- `/src/contexts/OrderDetails.tsx`

# Lesson 61: Review: Scoops Subtotal with Context

- `getByText` to find total
  - `exact` option set to `false`
- number inputs
  - `await` and `findBy` (coming from server async)
  - spinbutton _role_
  - `userEvent.clear` to clear exiting text
  - `userEvent.type` to enter number
- `wrapper` option to `render` to apply context provider
- Redfine Testing Library `render` to access universally

# Lesson 62: Code Quiz! Topping Subtotal

- Write tests for topping subtotal
- Not easy! Putting a lot of concepts together here
- Tests can go in _src/pages/order/tests/totalUpdates.test.jsx_
- Look at the mockup for inputs

  - e.g `Toppings total: $4.50`
  - Checkbox for `Gummi bears`, `Cherries`, `M&Ms`, and `Hot Fudge`

- Assert on default toppings subtotal
- Find and tick one box, assert on updated subtotal
  - See _/src/mock/handlers.js_ for server response (which toppings)
  - use `await` and `find` for checkbox (async)
- Tick another box on, assert on subtotal
  - Make sure code can handle two simultanious boxes
- Tick one of the boxes **off** (click it again) and assert on subtotal
  - Make sure code can handle box checked and then un-checked

Coding to pass tests

- Would recommend using pre-written code on this one
  - no need to learn react-bootstrap unless you want
- If you choose to write code to validate that tests pass
  - Should not have to make any cchanges to _Options.jsx_
    - logic for counting items and calculating subtotal in _Options.jsx_ is already written
    - re-usable without changes for toppings
  - Call `updateItemCount`, with `1` (checkbox on) or `0` (checkbox off)
- Update _ToppingOption.jsx_ to include names and checkboxes
  - `onChange` handler
  - use checkbox from _OrderSummary.jsx_ as a model

# Lesson 64: Code Quiz! Grand Total

- Subject matter for quiz is the _Grand Total_ on `OrderEntry` page
- Should we do a "black box" test (not consider implementation)?
- For example:
  - First update scoops, then toppings
  - Should we also test updating toppings first then scoops?
  - We know from implementation that it shouldn't make a difference
  - Users should be able to do either; and we might change implementation
- Do test functions need to be `async`?
  - Yes, options still need to load from server / mock service worker
  - await both the scoop element **and** another await on the topping element
    - they're separate operations and either could finish first

## How to find element

- From mockups, grand total should be the same size as titles (`<h2>`)
  - we can search using the `heading` role
    - include the text in the `name` option
- Note: `{ exact: false }` is not an _option_ for `*byRole`
  - Either use `*byRole` and regular expression for `name` option, or
    - `screen.getByRole('heading', {name: /grand total: \$/i });`
  - `*byText` and `{ exact: false }`
    - `screen.getByText('Grand total: $', { exact: false })`

## Ignore this error

- The first test will show an error even when passing:

```
Warning: ?Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted
component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory lead
in your application
```

- Ignore for now; will address when we reconvene

## Coding to pass tests

- Add grand total to `OrderEntry.tsx`
- Not a huge change
  - add `<h2>` with grand total from context

# Lesson 65: "Unmounted Component" Error

## Options to remedy

- Skip auto cleanup
  - https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/setup/#skipping-auto-cleanup
  - Not possible on a test-by-test basis
  - not recommended
- Mock useEffect to bypass server call
  - Not recommended, farther from production code path
- Include in the begginning of a test that asserts on state changes
  - One that awaits state changes
    - happen on axios promise resolution
  - Don't need to include in all tests because it only needs to be tested once

## What is there is no test?

- Add awaits to the end of the test to avoid errors
- I don't love this

# Lesson 66: What Should Functional Tests Catch? and Refactor

# Lesson 67: Introduction to Final Exam: Order Phases

## App orderPhase State

- App passes state setter (`setOrderPhase`) to components as prop
- Components call `setOrderPhase` to move to next phase
  - `inProgress` on `OrderEntry` page
  - `review` on `OrderSummary` page
  - `complete` on `OrderConfirmation` page

## What to Test

- "Happy path" (aka "Happy Day" or "Golden Path") test
  - Tests that execute customer flow without error
- For our app:
  - Create order
  - Accept terms and submit
  - Click "new order" on confirmation page
- Don't need to test different combinations of orders
  - Covered in order page testing

# Lesson 68 Adding a New Handler: Copy/Paste Warning

- POST order to server
  - implemententation: call POST via `useEffect` in `OrderConfirmation`
    - make up format of the data sent to server, or send or data
    - server simply generates random order number and sends it back as JSON
  - mimic POST for order confirmation with Mock Service Worker
- Warning about using copy/paste to create new handler
  - I do this all the time
  - If you do, be sure to change the method from `get` to `post`
  - If you neglect to do this, it's very difficult to track down!
    - Will get error like `Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1`

# Lesson 69 Debugging Tips

- `screen.debug()` - Prints out what the DOM looks like
- Does `getBy*` fail when there a server call or async action?
  - need to use `await findBy*`
- Read test error output carefully
  - don't get intimidated by huge walls of text!
  - exactly which assertion is failing?
  - copy/paste errors into web search
- Try pre-written code to se whether your tests or code are the issue
  - Clearly not a viable option in real life, but useful tool while learning

## Resolving errors from Tests

- `Unable to find role="role"` - Either role (for example, `button`) doesn't exist, or no element with
  that role that also matches the `name` option
- `Warning: An update to component inside a test was not wrapped in in act(...)` - There was an
  update to the component after the test completed. Use `await findBy*`
- `Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op...` - There
  was an update to the component state after the test completed. Use `await findBy*`
- `Error: conect ECONNREFUED 127.0.0.1` - There is no Mock Service Worker handler associated with this
  route and method

## Compare with Working Code

- copy/paste working code and comment your code
- if the copy/paste coded works then what's different in your code?

# Lesson 70: React Hints for Order Phase Coding

- State with `orderNumber, starts out null
- If `orderNumber` is `null`, display "Loading"
  - test "Loading" as optional practice
- `useEffect` to call axios when component mounts
  - Set `orderNumber` to axios response
  - Leve error as "TODO" (optional extra practice)

## React Coding Hints

- Keep `orderPhase` In App-level state
  - page setter to top-level page components
  - `orderPhase` value determines which page component to display
  - for simplicity, wrap everything in context provider
- buttons that update `orderPhase` state in pages
  - clicking button calls setter from prop
- reset context `Maps` after clicking "New Order" button
  - context needs additional array item `resetOrder`

# Lesson 73: Jest Mock Functions as Props

- Added a prop to lop level page components
  - `setOrderPhase
- Other components also have functions as props
  - `updateItemCount` for the ScoopOption / ToppingOption components
- May need to pass as prop when rendering in tests
  - TypeScript, PropTypes or other prop validators will require
  - Or will get called in tests, but doesn't matter for test
    - Testing that scoop count is invalid  wil call `updateItemCount`

- How to pass when rendering component in test?
- `jest.fn()`
  - Jest mock function
  - Does not do anything
  - Merely a placeholder to avoid errors
- Example:

```jsx
<ScoopOption
  name="Vanilla"
  imagePath="/images/vanilla.jpg"
  updateItemCount={jest.fn()} />
```

## Lesson 74: Final Exam and Introduction to Optional Practice

- Troubleshooting techniques
  - `screen.debug()` - prints out DOM structure
  - reading test error output carefully
  - probable causes for common errors
- Passing a function as prop: `jest.fn()`

### More Practice

- All code quiz!
- Adding more functionality to make app more realistic
- One minor concept not introduced yet
  - jest-dom assertion `toHaveClass` (*Validate scoop count value*)
- Practice using Jest mock `jest.fn()` as a placeholder for function prop
- Guidelines for questions when creating new tests

## Lesson 75. Standard Questions for New Tests and Introduction to Exercises

### Standard Questions to Ask

- What to render?
  - what's the smallest component that encompasses tests?
- Do we need to pass any props?
- Do we need to wrap in say, `OrderDetailsProvider`?
  - Does the provider get used? Is it already wrapped within the component?
- Where should the tests go?
  - which file? New file needed?
- What to test?
  - What's the behavior that needs testing?
- How to test?
  - What queries and events!
- Do we need to `await`?
  - Is there anything async going on?

### Exercises in this Section

- Confirm "Loading" shows while contacting server
  - async events
  - check that element disappears from DOM
- Optionally show "Toppings" on summary page
  - "happy path" test with different path
  - confirm element is not on page
- Disable order button if no scoops are ordered
  - conditions for button to be enabled
- Validate scoop count value
  - Jest mock function passed as prop
  - jest-dom `toHaveClass` assertion
- Don't update total if scoop count is invalid
  - minimum component to test
- Show alert for error when submitting order
  - error response from server

## Lesson 76. Confirm "Loading" Text

- Confirmation page is set to show "Loading" while order number is loading from server
- Update "happy path" test
  - Test "Loading" appears and then disappears
- Could use `waitForElementToBeRemoved` like we did with Terms & Conditions popover
  - not necessary because we can `await` what should appear after "Loading" is gone
  - not possible for popover, since nothing appeared when it disappeared
- In this case, can simply use query that expects "loading" not to be there
  - use cheat sheet for reference
  - https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet
- This is not TDD since code is already written
  - didn't want to add this to final exam, so much going on already!

## Lesson 77. Conditional Topping Section on Summary Page

- Don't display toppings heading on summary page if no toppings are ordered
- Similar to "final example happy path" test
  - new test, since outcome is different

### Standard Questions

1. What to render?  happy path usually means App
2. Pass props? No App has no props
3. Wrap render? No App already wraps within component
4. Which file for tests? `orderPhase.test.jsx` works; moving from one phase to another
5. What to tests?
  - Toppings header is not there
  - Anything else? No hard-and-fast right answers here!
6. How to test?  Which query to assert something's **not** on the page!
7. Do we need to async / await? Is there anything async going on?

## Lesson 78. Disable Order Button for No Scoops

1. What to render? `OrderEntry`
2. Pass props? `nextPhase` can be `jest.fn()`
3. Wrap render? Yes, this will render a component that calls `useOrderDetails`
4. Which file for tests? `OrderEntry.test.tsx`
5. What to test?
  - *Order Sundae* button is initially disabled
  - If there is scoop, it should be enabled
  - Remove scoop and it should be disabled
6. How to test?
7. Do we need to async / await? 

## Lesson 79. Red Input Box for Invalid Scoop Count

### Validate Scoop Count Value

- How to test tghat the box tgurned red?
  - Go to https://react-boostrap.netlify.app/components/forms/#forms-validation-native
  - Submit their example form with invalid (no) input                                             
- Use `.toHaveClass` assertion


1. What to render? `Scoop Option`
2. Pass props? `SetItemCount` needs jest mock function value `jest.fn()`
3. Wrap render? does `useOrderDetails` get called in component?
4. Which files for tests? `ScoopOption.test.jsx` (unit test for ScoopOption)
5. What to test? "box turns red" (i.e. `is-invalid` class)
6. How to test? covered in last slide
7. Do we need to asyhnc / await? Is there anyhthing async going on?

## Lesson 80. No Scoops Subtotal Update for Invalid Scoop Count

1. What to render? `Options`
2. Pass props? `optionType` set to *scoop*
3. Wrap render? yes. `useOrderDetails` gets called
4. Which files for tests? `Options.test.tsx`
5. What to test? Upon setting a scoop option to invalid number, the subtotal does not change.
6. How to test? Check that subtotal does not change.
7. Do we need to async / await? Not sure

## Lesson 81. Server Error on Order Confirmation Page

Show red error box message:

```
An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.
```

1. What to render? `OrderConfirmation`
2. Pass props? `nextPhase` mock
3. Wrap render? no.... does not `useOrderDetails`
4. Which files for tests?  `tests/OrderConfirmation.test.tsx`
5. What to test? That a message is present. `getByText`
6. How to test? Override order POST handler for this test
7. Do we need to async / await? Yes
